# Creating a book

There are many ways to create a GitBook. The easier way is using the online editor on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), but to customize, install plugins and themes, it's better to work on a local machine. To do that, you can either import a repo from GitBook or create it with [Gitbook-CLI](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).

## GitBook.com

To create it from web just follow the steps on [documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/) and you'll have a book published in less than one minute.

It's interface is like a text editor:![](/assets/gitbook-online.png)



You can check your **git repository url** by clicking on the arrow beside edit button:![](./assets/gitbook-git-repo.png)

### Sync GitBook with GitHub

In **Settings &gt; GitHub**, you can select a GitHub repository to sync.

First create the repository on GitHub, then set GitBook to sync with the new repo. You'll be asked to force sync of the content. You have to choose **which repository will overwrite **the content of the other, pay attention to not delete the wrong content.

Choose **Force sync using GitBook content **to update the new GitHub repository with the GitBook source code.
