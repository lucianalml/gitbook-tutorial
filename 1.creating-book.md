# Creating a book

There are many ways to create a GitBook. The easier way is using the online editor on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), but to customize, install plugins and themes, it's necessary to work locally. For that you can either import a repo from GitBook or GitHub or, create it with [Gitbook-CLI](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).

## GitBook.com

To create it from web just follow the steps on [documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/) and you'll have a book published in less than one minute.

You can check your **git repository url** by clicking on the arrow beside edit button

Choose **Force sync using GitBook content **to update the new GitHub repository with the GitBook source code.
