# Creating the book

There are many ways to create a GitBook. You can easily create it a book online at gitbook.com but to do more customizations and execute commands you will need to have a local repository that you can import from a git repository previously created, or you can create the book locally and then upload to gitbook or github.

## GitBook.com

To create it from web is very simple, just follow the steps on www.gitbook.com and you'll have a new book published in less than one minute.

You can access your git repository url by clicking on the arrow beside edit button. With this url you'll be able to clone this repository and work locally. ![](/assets/gitbook-git-repo.png)

You'll be able to connect to your GitBook account and the editor will import all your books. You can also create a new book locally that you be saved on your home and you can further set a git remote repository.
