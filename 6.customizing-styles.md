# Customizing Styles

To customize the styles, create a new folder `styles` on the root of the project and a file for each output style  
that you want to change.

| Type | File |
| :--- | :--- |
| website | website |
| pdf | pdf |

Assign the styles created in `book.json`.

```
{
    "styles": {
        "website": "styles/website.css",
        "ebook": "styles/ebook.css",
        "pdf": "styles/pdf.css",
        "mobi": "styles/mobi.css",
        "epub": "styles/epub.css"
    }
}
```

When working with multiple languages you have to set this inside **language specific** folder.

Now you will be able to set custom styles in that file:
