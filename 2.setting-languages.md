# Setting Multi-Languages

To set up multi-languages, you'll have to **change the file structure of the project** and create a new file `LANGS.md` in the root folder of the project.

To achieve this you have work on a local project. 

For example, let's clone a project: 

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:lucianalml/gitbook-tutorial.git
$ cd gitbook-tutorial
```

Open the project folder in a text editor.

Create a new file `LANGS.MD` in the root folder as the example:

```
# Languages

* [English](en/)
* [PortuguÃªs](pt/)
```

Create one folder for each language you'll translate, place the files of the book content inside this folders:

Now when you open your book you'll be asked to choose the language:
