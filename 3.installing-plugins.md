# Installing Plugins

The installation of plugins is done through a file `book.json` in the root of the project,

You may also have one `book.json` file inside any language specific folder, this definitions will extend the main `book.json` file,  but plugins are specified globally, and **language specific plugins cannot be specified.**

Available plugins can be found in [plugins directory](https://plugins.gitbook.com).



For example, to install [Google Analytics Plugin](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/ga), edit `book.json` adding the plugin name "ga" to** "plugins"** array. Some plugins has specific configurations, they can be set on **"pluginsCofig" **under a object with the same name of the plugin. The configuration format will be specified on plugin documentation.

```
{
    "plugins": ["ga"],
    "pluginsConfig": {
        "ga": {
            "token": "UA-XXXX-Y"
        }
    }
}
```

To install the plugin and reload the server, run the commands bellow:

```
$ gitbook install
$ gitbook serve
```
