# Installing Plugins

To install plugins you'll have to edit \(or create\) the file **book.json. **You may have on **book.json **in the root folder and on inside any language specific folder to extend the main configuration but plugins are specified globally.

To more information take a look at [documentation](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/plugins/).

Search available plugins [here](https://plugins.gitbook.com).

You'll have to add the plugin name to the file **book.json, **in **"plugins"** array. The plugin could also have specific configuration to be set on **"pluginsCofig" **object, as [Google Analytics Plugin](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/ga):

```
{
    "plugins": ["ga"],
    "pluginsConfig": {
        "ga": {
            "token": "UA-XXXX-Y"
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the commands bellow to install the plugin and reload the server:

```
$ gitbook install
$ gitbook serve
```
