# Customizing Themes

To customize a theme you have to create a new directory _layouts in the root folder, or in the language folder if
you have multiple languages set.

Inside this directory you can create one directory for each output format that you want to customize the pages.

The files inside this folder will overwrite the template of the selected theme.
