# Customizing Styles

To customize the styles, create a new folder `styles` on the root of the project and a file `website.css`.

Assign the new style created in `book.json`.

```
{
    "plugins": [],
    "styles": {
        "website": "styles/website.css"
    }
}
```

Now you will be able to set custom styles in that file:

```

```
