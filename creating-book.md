# Creating a book

There are many ways to create a GitBook. The easier way is using the online editor on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), but to customize, install plugins and themes, it's better to work on a local machine. To do that, you can either import a repo from GitBook or create it with [Gitbook-CLI](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).
